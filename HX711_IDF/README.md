# HX711_IDF
Library for HX711 for esp32 IDF 

An Esp32 IDF implementation for interfacing the Avia Semiconductor HX711 24-Bit Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) for Weight Scales. After much searching I realised there are many implementation for ESp32's Arudino IDE but none for IDF, so making the repo public which I used for a personal project. Datasheet for the ADC chip is below
